This is an ongoing project to digitize reparation lawsuits against Japanese colonial and wartime atrocities (most famously the "comfort women" system and Nanjing Massacre) into a graph database. Information about the lawsuits is taken from publicly available sources such as the 日本戦後補償裁判総覧 (http://justice.skr.jp/souran/souran-jp-web.htm), digitized, processed, and exported as cypher codes executable by graph database management or processing systems such as Neo4j.
